## [About Me](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/machine-learning-data-science/people/students/class-of-2025/betterman-jordan.html)
Hello! My name is Jordan Betterman. I am a Graduate Student at Northwestern University studying Machine Learning and Data Science (MLDS Program). I graduated from Drake University studying Data Analytics and Computer Science in May of 2024. 

## Projects
- ### [Predicting Play Type Using Presnap Data](https://github.com/jordan-betterman/football-analytics/tree/main/down_breaks)
    - I utilized a Random Forest Model to create a predicitve model of whether a team would run or pass the ball based on pre-snap data
    - The purpose of this projecc was to provide coaches with information to guide defensive playcalling decision making.
- ### [Fourth Down Decision Making](https://github.com/jordan-betterman/football-analytics/tree/main/fourth-down-decision-making)
    - Deciding what to do on fourth down is always a big decision to make. I wanted to provide my solution to the big question when playing in the Big Ten
- ### [DVOA Calculation](https://github.com/jordan-betterman/football-analytics/tree/main/dvoa)
    - No play is the same in football. DVOA is an advanced metric that can help evaluate how efficient a team is on offense over the course of a season
    - I also looked at the Big Ten teams (before expansion) and saw which teams were ranked higher than others based on this metric.
